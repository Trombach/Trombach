### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Luke, and I'm a computational chemist. I'm experienced with high-performance computing and tought myself how to code for my PhD. Somehow I ended up developing websites afterwards and now I'm trying to learn how these two very different things can be combined.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the [ResearchHub](https://github.com/UoA-eResearch/hub-stack)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust and WebAssembly
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on software for research
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Send me an email](mailto:TrombachL@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub])
- âš¡ Fun fact: A triangulation of a sphere needs to contain exaclty 12 vertices of degree 5
